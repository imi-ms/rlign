            Creates a binary template pattern for an ECG, specifically designed for positioning the QRST interval.
            This function is instrumental in establishing a standardized template that dictates the spatial
            arrangement of R-peaks within a cardiac cycle, tailored to a specific beats per minute (BPM) rate.

            Parameters:
                seconds_len:
                     Determines the duration of the ECG template in seconds.

                sampling_rate: The sampling rate for the template. This value must match the sampling rate
                    used for the input ECGs to ensure consistency and accuracy in the template creation.
                    The sampling rate determines the temporal resolution of the ECG data.

                template_bpm: The desired normalized BPM value for the template. This parameter sets the
                    heart rate around which the QRST pattern is structured, thereby standardizing the R-peak
                    positions according to a specific BPM.

                offset: The offset specifies the starting point for the first normalized QRS complex in the
                    template. In percentage of sampling_rate.


            Note:
                This class is integral to the ECG analysis process, providing a foundational template for
                subsequent signal processing and interpretation.

        Internal function which calls neurokit for rpeak and qrs-complex computation.

        Parameters:
            ecg_lead: An array representing a single-lead ECG signal. The input is
                expected to be a one-dimensional array of voltage values over time, representing
                the electrical activity of the heart as captured by a specific ECG lead.

            sampling_rate: Defines the sampling rate for all ECG recordings.

            neurokit_method: Chooses the algorithm for R-peak detection from the
                NeuroKit package. Different algorithms may offer varying performance
                based on the ECG signal characteristics.

            correct_artifacts: If set to True, artifact correction is applied
                exclusively for R-peak detections, enhancing the accuracy of peak
                identification in noisy signals.

        Returns:

                the outcomes of the R-peak detection and QRS complex computation processes,
                respectively. If an error occurs during the processing, the function
